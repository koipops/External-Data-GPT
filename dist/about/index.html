I found that using AI tools can be helpful with thought processes or brainstorming, but using AI tools to code for the assignment from Copilot or GPT-4o had some problems that confused me. Firstly, if you were to ask the AI step by step from the lab requirements, they all give different answers. On other problems, I see they put in codes but also not linking them, meaning if you were to ask them to add scripts like Tailwind, they will put the code in but not link them because the command was not specified.
<p>There are other problems I see using AI tools when coding for this assignment, but I can also provide some good feedback on using them. One thing that I thought was annoying or bad is that since it’s an AI tool, they use data in a certain list first to help solve the problem. For example, in the assignment, we were asked to render two endpoints with a selected JSON API, and the problem I found was, “The text you’re seeing is placeholder content from the JSONPlaceholder API. It's randomly generated Latin-like text used for testing,” so initially, one of my endpoints was not in English, which confused me. Another problem I had with the AI is having it create multiple .js files that connected to it for it to have it export info.</p>
